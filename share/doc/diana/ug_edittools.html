    <p>The edit dialogue is used during production of weather charts such as analyses and sigmaps. It
      contains drawing tools for fronts, areas and symbols.<br>
      Completed charts are stored in a shared directory for distribution to other regional offices.
      Charts can also be saved in the user's working directory.

    <p>
    New products are created using the Edit Drawing Dialogue which can be
    accessed via the <b>Show</b> menu or by pressing <i>Ctrl-Shift-B</i>.
    The data you are currently using when you create a drawing will remain
    visible while you create a product, so you need to ensure that you have
    already selected the <a href="ug_fielddialogue.html">fields</a>,
    <a href="ug_obsdialogue.html">observations</a>,
    <a href="ug_satdialogue.html">images</a> and other data you require before
    you start drawing.

    <p>
    The dialogue shows a list of <b>Active Layers</b>. These contain the
    objects that you can edit. Initially, there is only an empty scratch
    layer present in the list which can be used for quick work-in-progress
    drawings.
    </p>
    <p>
    Layers are visible in the main window when the <img src="drawing-visible.png">
    (visible) icon is present next to the name of the layer in the list. To hide
    a layer, click the icon next to its name. Click in the gap to make the layer
    visible again.
    </p>
    <p>
    New layers can be added by clicking the <img src="drawing-addempty.png">
    (add empty layer) button, and the currently selected layers can be deleted
    by clicking the <img src="drawing-remove.png"> (remove layer) button. Note
    that the scratch layer cannot be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
    Layers can also be loaded from disk by clicking the
    <img src="drawing-fileopen.png"> (open file) button. This allows the user to
    select a file from their working directory, or from other locations on the
    disk. To save one or more layers to a file, click the
    <img src="drawing-filesave.png"> (save file) button. This opens a dialogue
    that lets you choose name and location of the file that will contain the
    objects.
    </p>
    <p>
    The other buttons are explained below.

    <h3> Normal Editing</h3>
    <p>
    Objects can be created and edited using the drawing toolbar which is
    shown by opening the <b>Show</b> menu and selecting the <b>Edit Drawing
    Mode</b> entry, or by pressing <i>Ctrl-B</i>. The toolbar allows you to
    choose different kinds of object that will be placed in the currently
    selected layer in the Edit Drawing Dialogue. <!-- Note that it seems to
    be inserted into the first selected layer in the dialog. -->
    The left mouse button is used to click buttons and menus in the toolbar,
    as well as to add and select objects in the plot.

    The <img src="drawing-paint_create_polyline.png"> (create polyline)
    button is used to start creation of a front or area. Click the button to
    choose the type of front or area shown in the adjacent menu or open the
    menu and select the type you want. You can now start to draw the object
    by clicking on the locations where you want to add points.
    </p><p>
    To finish creating the object, use the right mouse button to add the last
    point. Don't worry if you have one point too many &ndash; it can be deleted
    later.

    The <img src="drawing-paint_select2.png"> (select) button is used to
    select and manipulate objects in the plot. When this tool is enabled, you
    can click on an object when it is highlighted and drag it to move it around
    in the plot. Release the mouse button when the object is in the desired
    position.
    </p><p>
    You can also modify an object by opening its context menu. Move the
    cursor over the object and click the right mouse button to open the menu.
    This allows you to cut or copy the object, edit its style and convert it
    to another object of a similar type. Note that keyboard shortcuts are also
    available for the cut (<i>Ctrl-X</i>) and copy (<i>Ctrl-C</i>) actions.

    black squares where each of their points are. These small squares can be
    moved around individually to change the shape of the object.

    If you open an object's context menu over a point, you can select the
    <b>Remove point</b> menu entry to delete that point. Alternatively, you
    can press the <i>Delete</i> or <i>Backspace</i> keys to delete it. This
    is useful if you accidentally created the object with too many points.

    a small green square appear. This shows where a new point can be placed.
    Opening the context menu reveals the <b>Add point</b> entry which can be
    selected to add a new point at the position indicated by the green square.

    As with fronts and areas, the symbol has four points that can be moved.
    However, these cannot be moved individually. Moving one of these points
    causes all of them to move &ndash; this allows you to resize the symbol.

    Click and drag a point to resize the symbol, and release the mouse button
