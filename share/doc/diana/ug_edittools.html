    <p>The edit dialogue is used during production of weather charts such as analyses and sigmaps. It
      contains drawing tools for fronts, areas and symbols.<br>
      Completed charts are stored in a shared directory for distribution to other regional offices.
      Charts can also be saved in the user's working directory.

    <h3>Viewing drawing products</h3>
    <p>
    New products are created using the Drawing Dialogue which can be
    accessed via the <b>Show</b> menu or by pressing <i>Alt-B</i>.
    The data you are currently using when you create a drawing will remain
    visible while you create a product, so you need to ensure that you have
    already selected the <a href="ug_fielddialogue.html">fields</a>,
    <a href="ug_obsdialogue.html">observations</a>,
    <a href="ug_satdialogue.html">images</a> and other data you require before
    you start drawing.

    The dialogue shows a list of <b>Products</b>. These contain the products that
    you can view and edit. Below this is a list of <b>Selected Products</b> that
    are being viewed by the user. Initially, the list of selected products is
    empty.
    </p>
    <p>
    To add a product to the list of selected products, select it in the upper
    list by clicking it. The product will then appear in the lower list.
    Click the <b>Apply</b> button to view the selected products in Diana's
    work area.
    </p>
    <p>
    To remove a selected product from the work area, either deselect it by
    clicking on it in the <b>Products</b> list or right-click on it in the
    <b>Selected Products</b> list to open a context menu and choose
    <b>Remove</b>. Click <b>Apply</b> to update the work area.
    </p>
    <p>
    Products can also be loaded from disk by clicking the <b>Load drawing...</b>
    button at the top-right of the window. This allows the user to select a file
    from their working directory, or from other locations on the disk.

    filter objects and the values held by those properties. Click on the
    values to select and deselect the ones that should be used to filter the
    visible objects - note that this has an immediate effect on the objects
    in the work area.

    <h3>Editing products</h3>
    <p>
    To edit objects from an existing product, first add it to the list of
    selected products as described above, right-click the product in the
    selected list to open a context menu and choose <b>Edit</b>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Objects can be created and edited using the drawing toolbar which is
    shown by opening the <b>Show</b> menu and selecting the <b>Edit Drawing
    Mode</b> entry, or by pressing <i>Ctrl-B</i>. The toolbar allows you to
    choose different kinds of object that will be placed in the currently
    selected layer in the Edit Drawing Dialogue. <!-- Note that it seems to
    be inserted into the first selected layer in the dialog. -->
    The left mouse button is used to click buttons and menus in the toolbar,
    as well as to add and select objects in the plot.

    The <img src="drawing-paint_create_polyline.png"> (create polyline)
    button is used to start creation of a front or area. Click the button to
    choose the type of front or area shown in the adjacent menu or open the
    menu and select the type you want. You can now start to draw the object
    by clicking on the locations where you want to add points.
    </p><p>
    To finish creating the object, use the right mouse button to add the last
    point. Don't worry if you have one point too many &ndash; it can be deleted
    later.

    The <img src="drawing-paint_select2.png"> (select) button is used to
    select and manipulate objects in the plot. When this tool is enabled, you
    can click on an object when it is highlighted and drag it to move it around
    in the plot. Release the mouse button when the object is in the desired
    position.
    </p><p>
    You can also modify an object by opening its context menu. Move the
    cursor over the object and click the right mouse button to open the menu.
    This allows you to cut or copy the object, edit its style and convert it
    to another object of a similar type. Note that keyboard shortcuts are also
    available for the cut (<i>Ctrl-X</i>) and copy (<i>Ctrl-C</i>) actions.

    black squares where each of their points are. These small squares can be
    moved around individually to change the shape of the object.

    If you open an object's context menu over a point, you can select the
    <b>Remove point</b> menu entry to delete that point. Alternatively, you
    can press the <i>Delete</i> or <i>Backspace</i> keys to delete it. This
    is useful if you accidentally created the object with too many points.

    Opening the context menu reveals the <b>Add point</b> entry which can be
    selected to add a new point at the position indicated by the green square.
    This is useful if you accidentally created the object with too few points.

    As with fronts and areas, the symbol has four points that can be moved.
    However, these cannot be moved individually. Moving one of these points
    causes all of them to move &ndash; this allows you to resize the symbol.

    Click and drag a point to resize the symbol, and release the mouse button
