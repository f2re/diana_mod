		Use the map dialogue to choose area, projection and map.</li>
	      <li>
		One <b>Area w/projection</b> is chosen from the top list.
		<ul>
		  <li> Model/sat-area means that the field or satellite picture
		    defines the projection and area.
		  <li>
		    The rest of the list is from the setup-file and defines regular cut-outs
		    with projection. The names should be self-explanatory.</li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Choose <b>background colour</b> from the list - applies to all chosen maps.
	      </li>

	      <li>
		<b>Lat/lon lines</b> turn on/off lines, with options for colour,
		thickness, density (decimal degrees) and plot position.
	      </li>

	      <li>
		<b>Show frame</b> puts a frame around the chosen area (in the top list). This can
		be turned on/off, with options for colour, line thickness and plot position.
		Note that this will not be shown when <i>model/sat-area</i> has been chosen.
	      </li>

	      <li>
	    	Note that it is possible to turn off all maps and only use the background
	    	colour optionally including lat/lon lines and area frame.
	      </li>

	      <li>
		Choose one or more maps. Maps can be unselected by clicking them a second time in
		the list, or by using the <b>Delete</b>-button on an element in the list <b>Selected maps</b>.
		Maps with names that contain <i>auto</i> have support for different resolutions
		depending on the size of the area being shown.
	      </li>

	      <li>
	    	For each map there are choices for <b>contour lines</b>.
	    	These are: colour, line thickness and position in relation to the other
	    	elements on the map (highest, lowest, auto).
	    	The options apply to the map highlighted in <b>Selected maps</b>.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		For some maps <b>Filled land</b> can be chosen and colour and position
		is set. For these, contour lines can be turned off.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	    	All selections are logged to file -  so they are kept for the next time
	    	Diana is run. There are exceptions for high-resolution maps which would
	    	be very hard to run for a large area.
	      </li>
	      <li>
	    	Use <b>Save favourite</b> when you want to save a map-layout you like.
	    	This is easily retrieved with <b>Use favourite</b>
	      </li>
