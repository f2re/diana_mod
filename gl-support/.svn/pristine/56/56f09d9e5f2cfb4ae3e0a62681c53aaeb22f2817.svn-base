 * translating to the right of it.
 *
 * See the m_charTable member of TextRenderer for an example of use of
 * this class.

class CharRenderer {

  /**
   * The OpenGL texture object
   */

  /**
   * The OpenGL display list
   */
  GLuint m_displayList;

   * Width and height in pixels of the rendered character
   */

/** This class renders text inside a QGLWidget. It replaces the functionality
 * of QGLWidget::renderText(). The advantages over renderText() include:
 *  - supports any font, any character encoding supported by Qt
 *    (renderText is 8-bit-only and can only use "OpenGL-compatible" fonts)
 *  - does not use any library outside Qt (renderText uses FreeType on X11)
 *  - renders characters as textured quads instead of calling glDrawPixels,
 *    which does not make much of a difference on MesaGL, but can be a lot
 *    faster and safer with other (buggy) OpenGL implementations. It will also
 *    allow to add more graphical effects in the future, like rotation,
 *    if we ever need that.
 *  - the characters are stored as 8bpp Alpha, which takes 4 times less
 *    memory than the 32bpp RGBA used by renderText.
 *  - the characters are rendered on-the-fly on the first time they appear
 *    in a QString being printed. This is achieved using a QHash to test whether
 *    a character has already been rendered.
 *
 * Recommended usage:
 * The TextRender class is meant to be used from inside a child class of
 * QGLWidget, say MyGLWidget.
 *
 * In the declaration of MyGLWidget, please declare a TextRenderer member:
 *
 * @code
 class MyGLWidget : public QGLWidget
 {
 ...
 TextRenderer m_textRenderer;
 ...
 };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, in the constructor of MyGLWidget, please call setup() along these lines:
 *
 * @code
 QFont f;
 f.setStyleHint( QFont::SansSerif, QFont::PreferAntialias );
 m_textRenderer.setup( this, f );
 * @endcode
 *
 * The setup() method should be called only once, which means you have to choose
 * a font once and for all, in the lifetime of your TextRenderer. Any QFont can
 * be used, the above is just an example. Now, to actually render text, in
 * the MyGLWidget::paintGL() method, you can call

 * @code
 m_textRenderer.print( x, y, string );
 * @endcode

 * where x,y are ints and string is any QString. If you want to choose a color,
 * please call glColor3f or glColor4f before calling print(). Of course you can
 * also call qglColor. You can achieve semitransparent text at
 * no additional cost by choosing a semitransparent color.
 *
 * If you wish to do several calls to print(), it will improve performance
 * to enclose them between a call to begin() and a call to end(), like that:
 *
 * @code
 m_textRenderer.begin();
 m_textRenderer.print( x1, y1, string1 );
 m_textRenderer.print( x2, y2, string2 );
 m_textRenderer.print( x3, y2, string3 );
 m_textRenderer.end();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Please make sure, though, that no relevant OpenGL state change occurs between
 * begin() and end(), except the state changes performed by the TextRenderer
 * itself. In other words, please avoid calling glSomething() between begin() and
 * end(), except if you are sure that this call won't perform a relevant state
 * change.
 *
 * The print() method when called alone, or the begin()-print()-end() group,
 * do restore the OpenGL state as they found it, including the matrices.
 *
 * If you experience rendering problems, you can try the following:
 * - disable some OpenGL state bits. For instance, TextRenderer automatically
 *   disables fog and lighting during rendering, because it doesn't work
 *   correctly with them enabled. There probably are other OpenGL state bits
 *   that have to be disabled, so if your program enables some of them, you
 *   might have to disable them before rendering text.
 * - if you experience poor font quality, please consider using an antialiased
 *   font.
