# 1. About Diana
#-------------------------------------------

Diana is the core visualisation tool from MET Norway (Norwegian Meteorological
Institute) and is distributed under the GPL license. See gpl.txt for details
concerning the GPL license.

Diana is a graphical viewer and editor developed for use with meteorological
and oceanographic data.  It uses OpenGL for the graphics and Qt for the user
interface.

Diana shows fields, observations and satellite and radar images on a map.
2D-trajectories can be computed from wind and ocean current fields.  The tool
also displays vertical profiles (soundings), vertical crossections and wave
spectrum data in separate windows, all from preprocessed data. Preprocessing
software is however not a part of Diana.  The editor tools consist of a field
editor and a drawing tool for fronts, symbols and area types.

Diana supports multiple languages via the Qt Linguist system. Additional
languages can be added by preparing new diana/lang/diana_XX.ts files (using
the Qt Linguist program) and running "make languages".

In addition to the interactive tool, there is also a command line version of
Diana for batch plotting (bdiana).  This can be built against embedded
versions of the Qt libraries in order to run on systems without displays,
such as servers.
